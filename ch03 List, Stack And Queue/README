Exercises

3.1 You are given a list, L, and another list, P, containing integers sorted in ascending
order. The operation printLots(L,P) will print the elements in L that are in positions
speciﬁed by P. For instance, if P = 1, 3, 4, 6, the elements in positions 1, 3, 4, and 6
in L are printed. Write the procedure printLots(L,P). You may use only the public
Collections API container operations. What is the running time of your procedure?



3.2 Swap two adjacent elements by adjusting only the links (and not the data) using:
a. Singly linked lists.
b. Doubly linked lists.


3.3 Implement the contains routine for MyLinkedList.




3.4 Given two sorted lists, L1 and L2, write a procedure to compute L1 ∩ L2 using only
the basic list operations.



3.5 Given two sorted lists, L1 and L2, write a procedure to compute L1 ∪ L2 using only
the basic list operations.


3.6 The Josephus problem is the following game: N people, numbered 1 to N, are sitting
in a circle. Starting at person 1, a hot potato is passed. After M passes, the person
holding the hot potato is eliminated, the circle closes ranks, and the game continues
with the person who was sitting after the eliminated person picking up the hot
potato. The last remaining person wins. Thus, if M = 0 and N = 5, players are
eliminated in order, and player 5 wins. If M = 1 and N = 5, the order of elimination
is 2, 4, 1, 5.
a. Write a program to solve the Josephus problem for general values of M and N.
Try to make your program as efﬁcient as possible. Make sure you dispose of
cells.
b. What is the running time of your program?


3.7 What is the running time of the following code?
public static List<Integer> makeList( int N ) {
    ArrayList<Integer> lst = new ArrayList<>( );
    for( int i = 0; i < N; i++ ) {
        lst.add( i );
        lst.trimToSize( );
    }
}
